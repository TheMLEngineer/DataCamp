 How many clusters?
You are given an array points of size 300x2, where each row gives the (x, y) co-ordinates of a point on a map. Make a scatter plot of these points, and use the scatter plot to guess how many clusters there are.

matplotlib.pyplot has already been imported as plt. In the IPython Shell:


 Q : 
 
 Create an array called xs that contains the values of points[:,0] - that is, column 0 of points.
Create an array called ys that contains the values of points[:,1] - that is, column 1 of points.
Make a scatter plot by passing xs and ys to the plt.scatter() function.
Call the plt.show() function to show your plot.
How many clusters do you see?


 A : 
 
 3

 Ref : 
 
 Clustering 2D points
From the scatter plot of the previous exercise, you saw that the points seem to separate into 3 clusters. You'll now create a KMeans model to find 3 clusters, and fit it to the data points from the previous exercise. After the model has been fit, you'll obtain the cluster labels for some new points using the .predict() method.

You are given the array points from the previous exercise, and also an array new_points.


 Q : 
 
 Import KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
Using KMeans(), create a KMeans instance called model to find 3 clusters. To specify the number of clusters, use the n_clusters keyword argument.
Use the .fit() method of model to fit the model to the array of points points.
Use the .predict() method of model to predict the cluster labels of new_points, assigning the result to labels.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the cluster labels of new_points.



# Import KMeans
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create a KMeans instance with 3 clusters: model

Great work! You've successfully performed k-Means clustering and predicted the labels of new points. But it is not easy to inspect the clustering by just looking at the printed labels. A visualization would be far more useful. In the next exercise, you'll inspect your clustering with a scatter plot!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Ref : 
 
 Inspect your clustering
Let's now inspect the clustering you performed in the previous exercise!

A solution to the previous exercise has already run, so new_points is an array of points and labels is the array of their cluster labels.




 Q : 
 
 
 
 Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Assign column 0 of new_points to xs, and column 1 of new_points to ys.
Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, specifying the c=labels keyword arguments to color the points by their cluster label. Also specify alpha=0.5.
Compute the coordinates of the centroids using the .cluster_centers_ attribute of model.
Assign column 0 of centroids to centroids_x, and column 1 of centroids to centroids_y.
Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y, using 'D' (a diamond) as a marker by specifying the marker parameter. Set the size of the markers to be 50 using s=50.




# Import pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assign the columns of new_points: xs and ys
xs = new_points[:, 0]
ys = new_points[:, 1]

# Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, using labels to define the colors
plt.scatter(xs , ys , alpha = 0.5 , c = labels)

# Assign the cluster centers: centroids
centroids = model.cluster_centers_

# Assign the columns of centroids: centroids_x, centroids_y
centroids_x = centroids[:,0]
centroids_y = centroids[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y
plt.scatter(centroids_x , centroids_y , marker = 'D' , s = 50)
plt.show()



Fantastic! The clustering looks great! But how can you be sure that 3 clusters is the correct choice? In other words, how can you evaluate the quality of a clustering? Tune into the next video in which Ben will explain how to evaluate a clustering!

 Ref : 
 
 How many clusters of grain?
In the video, you learned how to choose a good number of clusters for a dataset using the k-means inertia graph. You are given an array samples containing the measurements (such as area, perimeter, length, and several others) of samples of grain. What's a good number of clusters in this case?

KMeans and PyPlot (plt) have already been imported for you.

This dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


 Q : 
 
 
 For each of the given values of k, perform the following steps:
Create a KMeans instance called model with k clusters.
Fit the model to the grain data samples.
Append the value of the inertia_ attribute of model to the list inertias.
The code to plot ks vs inertias has been written for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!




ks = range(1, 6)
inertias = []

for k in ks:
    # Create a KMeans instance with k clusters: model
    model = KMeans(n_clusters = k)
    
    # Fit model to samples
    model.fit(samples)
    
    # Append the inertia to the list of inertias
    inertias.append(model.inertia_)
    
# Plot ks vs inertias
plt.plot(ks, inertias, '-o')
plt.xlabel('number of clusters, k')
plt.ylabel('inertia')
plt.xticks(ks)
plt.show()



Excellent job! The inertia decreases very slowly from 3 clusters to 4, so it looks like 3 clusters would be a good choice for this data.

 Ref : 
 
 Evaluating the grain clustering
In the previous exercise, you observed from the inertia plot that 3 is a good number of clusters for the grain data. In fact, the grain samples come from a mix of 3 different grain varieties: "Kama", "Rosa" and "Canadian". In this exercise, cluster the grain samples into three clusters, and compare the clusters to the grain varieties using a cross-tabulation.

You have the array samples of grain samples, and a list varieties giving the grain variety for each sample. Pandas (pd) and KMeans have already been imported for you.


 Q : 
 
 
 
 Create a KMeans model called model with 3 clusters.
Use the .fit_predict() method of model to fit it to samples and derive the cluster labels. Using .fit_predict() is the same as using .fit() followed by .predict().
Create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'varieties', using labels and varieties, respectively, for the column values. This has been done for you.
Use the pd.crosstab() function on df['labels'] and df['varieties'] to count the number of times each grain variety coincides with each cluster label. Assign the result to ct.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the cross-tabulation!



# Create a KMeans model with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters = 3)

# Use fit_predict to fit model and obtain cluster labels: labels
labels = model.fit_predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and varieties as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'varieties': varieties})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'], df['varieties'])

# Display ct
print(ct)




<script.py> output:
    varieties  Canadian wheat  Kama wheat  Rosa wheat
    labels                                           
    0                       0           1          60

Great work! The cross-tabulation shows that the 3 varieties of grain separate really well into 3 clusters. But depending on the type of data you are working with, the clustering may not always be this good. Is there anything you can do in such situations to improve your clustering? You'll find out in the next video!

 Ref : 
 
 Scaling fish data for clustering
You are given an array samples giving measurements of fish. Each row represents an individual fish. The measurements, such as weight in grams, length in centimeters, and the percentage ratio of height to length, have very different scales. In order to cluster this data effectively, you'll need to standardize these features first. In this exercise, you'll build a pipeline to standardize and cluster the data.

These fish measurement data were sourced from the Journal of Statistics Education.


 Q : 
 
 Import:
make_pipeline from sklearn.pipeline.
StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
Create an instance of StandardScaler called scaler.
Create an instance of KMeans with 4 clusters called kmeans.
Create a pipeline called pipeline that chains scaler and kmeans. To do this, you just need to pass them in as arguments to make_pipeline().



# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create scaler: scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Create KMeans instance: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 4)

# Create pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(scaler , kmeans)



Great work! Now that you've built the pipeline, you'll use it in the next exercise to cluster the fish by their measurements.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Ref : 
 
 Clustering the fish data
You'll now use your standardization and clustering pipeline from the previous exercise to cluster the fish by their measurements, and then create a cross-tabulation to compare the cluster labels with the fish species.

As before, samples is the 2D array of fish measurements. Your pipeline is available as pipeline, and the species of every fish sample is given by the list species.


 Q : 
 
 Import pandas as pd.
Fit the pipeline to the fish measurements samples.
Obtain the cluster labels for samples by using the .predict() method of pipeline.
Using pd.DataFrame(), create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'species', using labels and species, respectively, for the column values.
Using pd.crosstab(), create a cross-tabulation ct of df['labels'] and df['species'].



# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Fit the pipeline to samples
pipeline.fit(samples)

# Calculate the cluster labels: labels
labels = pipeline.predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and species as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({  'labels' : labels,  'species' : species})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'] , df['species'])

# Display ct
print(ct)




<script.py> output:
    species  Bream  Pike  Roach  Smelt
    labels                            
    0            0     0      0     13
    1           33     0      1      0
    2            0    17      0      0
    3            1     0     19      1
	
	
Excellent! It looks like the fish data separates really well into 4 clusters!

 Ref : 
 
 
 
 Clustering stocks using KMeans
In this exercise, you'll cluster companies using their daily stock price movements (i.e. the dollar difference between the closing and opening prices for each trading day). You are given a NumPy array movements of daily price movements from 2010 to 2015 (obtained from Yahoo! Finance), where each row corresponds to a company, and each column corresponds to a trading day.

Some stocks are more expensive than others. To account for this, include a Normalizer at the beginning of your pipeline. The Normalizer will separately transform each company's stock price to a relative scale before the clustering begins.

Note that Normalizer() is different to StandardScaler(), which you used in the previous exercise. While StandardScaler() standardizes features (such as the features of the fish data from the previous exercise) by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, Normalizer() rescales each sample - here, each company's stock price - independently of the other.

KMeans and make_pipeline have already been imported for you.




 Q : 
 
 Import Normalizer from sklearn.preprocessing.
Create an instance of Normalizer called normalizer.
Create an instance of KMeans called kmeans with 10 clusters.
Using make_pipeline(), create a pipeline called pipeline that chains normalizer and kmeans.
Fit the pipeline to the movements array.



# Import Normalizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer

# Create a normalizer: normalizer
normalizer = Normalizer()

# Create a KMeans model with 10 clusters: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 10)

# Make a pipeline chaining normalizer and kmeans: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(normalizer , kmeans)

# Fit pipeline to the daily price movements
pipeline.fit(movements)



Great work - you're really getting the hang of this. Now that your pipeline has been set up, you can find out which stocks move together in the next exercise!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Ref : 
 
 
 
 Which stocks move together?
In the previous exercise, you clustered companies by their daily stock price movements. So which company have stock prices that tend to change in the same way? You'll now inspect the cluster labels from your clustering to find out.

Your solution to the previous exercise has already been run. Recall that you constructed a Pipeline pipeline containing a KMeans model and fit it to the NumPy array movements of daily stock movements. In addition, a list companies of the company names is available.




 Q : 
 
 
 
 Import pandas as pd.
Use the .predict() method of the pipeline to predict the labels for movements.
Align the cluster labels with the list of company names companies by creating a DataFrame df with labels and companies as columns. This has been done for you.
Use the .sort_values() method of df to sort the DataFrame by the 'labels' column, and print the result.
Hit 'Submit Answer' and take a moment to see which companies are together in each cluster!




# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Predict the cluster labels: labels
labels = pipeline.predict(movements)

# Create a DataFrame aligning labels and companies: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'companies': companies})

# Display df sorted by cluster label
print(df.sort_values('labels'))

Fantastic job - you have completed Chapter 1! Take a look at the clusters. Are you surprised by any of the results? In the next chapter, you'll learn about how to communicate results such as this through visualizations.

 Q : 


How many merges?
If there are 5 data samples, how many merge operations will occur in a hierarchical clustering? To help answer this question, think back to the video, in which Ben walked through an example of hierarchical clustering using 6 countries. How many merge operations did that example have?



 A : 


4 merges.

    Well done! With 5 data samples, there would be 4 merge operations, and with 6 data samples, there would be 5 merges, and so on.

Hierarchical clustering of the grain data
In the video, you learned that the SciPy linkage() function performs hierarchical clustering on an array of samples. Use the linkage() function to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the grain samples, and use dendrogram() to visualize the result. A sample of the grain measurements is provided in the array samples, while the variety of each grain sample is given by the list varieties.

 Ref : 


Hierarchies of stocks
In chapter 1, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. Now, you'll perform hierarchical clustering of the companies. You are given a NumPy array of price movements movements, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names companies. SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the normalize() function from sklearn.preprocessing instead of Normalizer.

linkage and dendrogram have already been imported from sklearn.cluster.hierarchy, and PyPlot has been imported as plt.




 Q : 


Import normalize from sklearn.preprocessing.
Rescale the price movements for each stock by using the normalize() function on movements.
Apply the linkage() function to normalized_movements, using 'complete' linkage, to calculate the hierarchical clustering. Assign the result to mergings.
Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list companies of company names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you did in the previous exercise.





# Import normalize
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize

# Normalize the movements: normalized_movements
normalized_movements = normalize(movements)

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(normalized_movements , method = 'complete')

# Plot the dendrogram
dendrogram(
    mergings , 
    labels = companies , 
    leaf_rotation = 90,
    leaf_font_size = 6
    )
plt.show()




Great work! You can produce great visualizations such as this with hierarchical clustering, but it can be used for more than just visualizations. You'll find out more about this in the next video!

 Ref : 


Which clusters are closest?
In the video, you learned that the linkage method defines how the distance between clusters is measured. In complete linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the furthest points of the clusters. In single linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the closest points of the clusters.


 Q : 


 Consider the three clusters in the diagram. Which of the following statements are true?

A. In single linkage, cluster 3 is the closest to cluster 2.

B. In complete linkage, cluster 1 is the closest to cluster 2.




 A : 




Both A and B.

 Ref : 



Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!
In the video, you saw a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries at the Eurovision song contest using 'complete' linkage. Now, perform a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries with 'single' linkage, and compare the resulting dendrogram with the one in the video. Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!

You are given an array samples. Each row corresponds to a voting country, and each column corresponds to a performance that was voted for. The list country_names gives the name of each voting country. This dataset was obtained from Eurovision.



 Q : 


Import:
linkage and dendrogram from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Perform hierarchical clustering on samples using the linkage() function with the method='single' keyword argument. Assign the result to mergings.
Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list country_names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you have done earlier.





# Perform the necessary imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage , dendrogram

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(samples , method = 'single')

# Plot the dendrogram
dendrogram(mergings , 
labels = country_names , 
leaf_rotation = 90 , 
leaf_font_size = 6)
plt.show()



Great work! As you can see, performing single linkage hierarchical clustering produces a different dendrogram!

 Q : 


Intermediate clusterings
Displayed on the right is the dendrogram for the hierarchical clustering of the grain samples that you computed earlier. If the hierarchical clustering were stopped at height 6 on the dendrogram, how many clusters would there be?


 A : 


3.


Exactly - great work!




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Ref : 


Extracting the cluster labels
In the previous exercise, you saw that the intermediate clustering of the grain samples at height 6 has 3 clusters. Now, use the fcluster() function to extract the cluster labels for this intermediate clustering, and compare the labels with the grain varieties using a cross-tabulation.

The hierarchical clustering has already been performed and mergings is the result of the linkage() function. The list varieties gives the variety of each grain sample.



 Q : 



Import:
pandas as pd.
fcluster from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
Perform a flat hierarchical clustering by using the fcluster() function on mergings. Specify a maximum height of 6 and the keyword argument criterion='distance'.
Create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'varieties', using labels and varieties, respectively, for the column values. This has been done for you.
Create a cross-tabulation ct between df['labels'] and df['varieties'] to count the number of times each grain variety coincides with each cluster label.




# Perform the necessary imports
import pandas as pd
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import fcluster

# Use fcluster to extract labels: labels
labels = fcluster(mergings , 6 , criterion = 'distance')

# Create a DataFrame with labels and varieties as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'varieties': varieties})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'] , df['varieties'])

# Display ct
print(ct)





<script.py> output:
    varieties  Canadian wheat  Kama wheat  Rosa wheat
    labels

t-SNE visualization of grain dataset
In the video, you saw t-SNE applied to the iris dataset. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the grain samples data and inspect the resulting t-SNE features using a scatter plot. You are given an array samples of grain samples and a list variety_numbers giving the variety number of each grain sample.





 Q : 


Import TSNE from sklearn.manifold.
Create a TSNE instance called model with learning_rate=200.
Apply the .fit_transform() method of model to samples. Assign the result to tsne_features.
Select the column 0 of tsne_features. Assign the result to xs.
Select the column 1 of tsne_features. Assign the result to ys.
Make a scatter plot of the t-SNE features xs and ys. To color the points by the grain variety, specify the additional keyword argument c=variety_numbers.




# Import TSNE
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

# Create a TSNE instance: model
model = TSNE(learning_rate = 200)

# Apply fit_transform to samples: tsne_features
tsne_features = model.fit_transform(samples)

# Select the 0th feature: xs
xs = tsne_features[:,0]

# Select the 1st feature: ys
ys = tsne_features[:,1]

# Scatter plot, coloring by variety_numbers
plt.scatter(xs , ys , c = variety_numbers)
plt.show()



Excellent! As you can see, the t-SNE visualization manages to separate the 3 varieties of grain samples. But how will it perform on the stock data? You'll find out in the next exercise!

A t-SNE map of the stock market
t-SNE provides great visualizations when the individual samples can be labeled. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the company stock price data. A scatter plot of the resulting t-SNE features, labeled by the company names, gives you a map of the stock market! The stock price movements for each company are available as the array normalized_movements (these have already been normalized for you). The list companies gives the name of each company. PyPlot (plt) has been imported for you.



 Q : 


Import TSNE from sklearn.manifold.
Create a TSNE instance called model with learning_rate=50.
Apply the .fit_transform() method of model to normalized_movements. Assign the result to tsne_features.
Select column 0 and column 1 of tsne_features.
Make a scatter plot of the t-SNE features xs and ys. Specify the additional keyword argument alpha=0.5.
Code to label each point with its company name has been written for you using plt.annotate(), so just hit 'Submit Answer' to see the visualization!

tsne_features = model.fit_transform(normalized_movements)

# Select the 0th feature: xs
xs = tsne_features[: , 0]

# Select the 1th feature: ys
ys = tsne_features[:,1]

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(xs , ys , alpha = 0.5)

# Annotate the points
for x, y, company in zip(xs, ys, companies):
    plt.annotate(company, (x, y), fontsize=5, alpha=0.75)
plt.show()




Fantastic! It's visualizations such as this that make t-SNE such a powerful tool for extracting quick insights from high dimensional data.

Decorrelating the grain measurements with PCA
You observed in the previous exercise that the width and length measurements of the grain are correlated. Now, you'll use PCA to decorrelate these measurements, then plot the decorrelated points and measure their Pearson correlation.




 Q : 



Import PCA from sklearn.decomposition.
Create an instance of PCA called model.
Use the .fit_transform() method of model to apply the PCA transformation to grains. Assign the result to pca_features.

Principal components
On the right are three scatter plots of the same point cloud. Each scatter plot shows a different set of axes (in red). In which of the plots could the axes represent the principal components of the point cloud?

Recall that the principal components are the directions along which the the data varies.


(Image is seen in exercise)


 A : 


Both plot 1 and plot 3.





Well done! You've correctly inferred that the principal components have to align with the axes of the point cloud. This happens in both plot 1 and plot 3.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Ref : 



The first principal component
The first principal component of the data is the direction in which the data varies the most. In this exercise, your job is to use PCA to find the first principal component of the length and width measurements of the grain samples, and represent it as an arrow on the scatter plot.

The array grains gives the length and width of the grain samples. PyPlot (plt) and PCA have already been imported for you.





 Q : 


Make a scatter plot of the grain measurements. This has been done for you.
Create a PCA instance called model.
Fit the model to the grains data.
Extract the coordinates of the mean of the data using the .mean_ attribute of model.
Get the first principal component of model using the .components_[0,:] attribute.
Plot the first principal component as an arrow on the scatter plot, using the plt.arrow() function. You have to specify the first two arguments - mean[0] and mean[1].




# Make a scatter plot of the untransformed points
plt.scatter(grains[:,0], grains[:,1])

# Create a PCA instance: model
model = PCA()

# Fit model to points
model.fit(grains)

# Get the mean of the grain samples: mean
mean = model.mean_

# Get the first principal component: first_pc
first_pc = model.components_[0 , :]

# Plot first_pc as an arrow, starting at mean
plt.arrow(mean[0] , mean[1] , first_pc[0], first_pc[1], color='red', width=0.01)

# Keep axes on same scale
plt.axis('equal')

Variance of the PCA features
The fish dataset is 6-dimensional. But what is its intrinsic dimension? Make a plot of the variances of the PCA features to find out. As before, samples is a 2D array, where each row represents a fish. You'll need to standardize the features first.




 Q : 



Create an instance of StandardScaler called scaler.
Create a PCA instance called pca.
Use the make_pipeline() function to create a pipeline chaining scaler and pca.
Use the .fit() method of pipeline to fit it to the fish samples samples.
Extract the number of components used using the .n_components_ attribute of pca. Place this inside a range() function and store the result as features.
Use the plt.bar() function to plot the explained variances, with features on the x-axis and pca.explained_variance_ on the y-axis.






# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

features = range(pca.n_components_)
plt.bar(features , pca.explained_variance_)
plt.xlabel('PCA feature')
plt.ylabel('variance')
plt.xticks(features)

 Q : 


ntrinsic dimension of the fish data
In the previous exercise, you plotted the variance of the PCA features of the fish measurements. Looking again at your plot, what do you think would be a reasonable choice for the "intrinsic dimension" of the the fish measurements? Recall that the intrinsic dimension is the number of PCA features with significant variance.





 A : 


2



Great job! Since PCA features 0 and 1 have significant variance, the intrinsic dimension of this dataset appears to be 2.

Dimension reduction of the fish measurements
In a previous exercise, you saw that 2 was a reasonable choice for the "intrinsic dimension" of the fish measurements. Now use PCA for dimensionality reduction of the fish measurements, retaining only the 2 most important components.

The fish measurements have already been scaled for you, and are available as scaled_samples.



 Q : 


Import PCA from sklearn.decomposition.
Create a PCA instance called pca with n_components=2.
Use the .fit() method of pca to fit it to the scaled fish measurements scaled_samples.
Use the .transform() method of pca to transform the scaled_samples. Assign the result to pca_features.




# Import PCA
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Create a PCA model with 2 components: pca
pca = PCA(n_components = 2)

# Fit the PCA instance to the scaled samples
pca.fit(scaled_samples)

# Transform the scaled samples: pca_features

In the next exercise, you'll apply it to the word-frequency array of some Wikipedia articles.

Create a Pipeline object consisting of a TruncatedSVD followed by KMeans. (This time, we've precomputed the word-frequency matrix for you, so there's no need for a TfidfVectorizer).

Fantastic! Take a look at the cluster labels and see if you can identify any patterns!

 Q : 


Non-negative data
Which of the following 2-dimensional arrays are examples of non-negative data?

A tf-idf word-frequency array.
An array daily stock market price movements (up and down), where each row represents a company.
An array where rows are customers, columns are products and entries are 0 or 1, indicating whether a customer has purchased a product.



 A : 


1 and 3
press


Well done! Stock prices can go down as well as up, so an array of daily stock market price movements is not an example of non-negative data.

NMF applied to Wikipedia articles
In the video, you saw NMF applied to transform a toy word-frequency array. Now it's your turn to apply NMF, this time using the tf-idf word-frequency array of Wikipedia articles, given as a csr matrix articles. Here, fit the model and transform the articles. In the next exercise, you'll explore the result.





 Q : 


Import NMF from sklearn.decomposition.
Create an NMF instance called model with 6 components.
Fit the model to the word count data articles.
Use the .transform() method of model to transform articles, and assign the result to nmf_features.
Print nmf_features to get a first idea what it looks like.




# Import NMF
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create an NMF instance: model
model = NMF(n_components = 6)

# Fit the model to articles
model.fit(articles)

# Transform the articles: nmf_features
nmf_features = model.transform(articles)

# Print the NMF features
print(nmf_features)

NMF features of the Wikipedia articles
Now you will explore the NMF features you created in the previous exercise. A solution to the previous exercise has been pre-loaded, so the array nmf_features is available. Also available is a list titles giving the title of each Wikipedia article.

When investigating the features, notice that for both actors, the NMF feature 3 has by far the highest value. This means that both articles are reconstructed using mainly the 3rd NMF component. In the next video, you'll see why: NMF components represent topics (for instance, acting!).



 Q : 


Import pandas as pd.
Create a DataFrame df from nmf_features using pd.DataFrame(). Set the index to titles using index=titles.
Use the .loc[] accessor of df to select the row with title 'Anne Hathaway', and print the result. These are the NMF features for the article about the actress Anne Hathaway.
Repeat the last step for 'Denzel Washington' (another actor).




# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(nmf_features , index = titles)

# Print the row for 'Anne Hathaway'

# Print the row for 'Denzel Washington'
print(df.loc['Denzel Washington'])

NMF reconstructs samples
In this exercise, you'll check your understanding of how NMF reconstructs samples from its components using the NMF feature values. On the right are the components of an NMF model. If the NMF feature values of a sample are [2, 1], then which of the following is most likely to represent the original sample? A pen and paper will help here! You have to apply the same technique Ben used in the video to reconstruct the sample [0.1203 0.1764 0.3195 0.141].


    
Hint  :


You'll need to multiply the NMF components by the NMF feature values of the sample, and add up the columns. Referring back to the slides may help here.

NMF learns topics of documents
In the video, you learned when NMF is applied to documents, the components correspond to topics of documents, and the NMF features reconstruct the documents from the topics. Verify this for yourself for the NMF model that you built earlier using the Wikipedia articles. Previously, you saw that the 3rd NMF feature value was high for the articles about actors Anne Hathaway and Denzel Washington. In this exercise, identify the topic of the corresponding NMF component.

The NMF model you built earlier is available as model, while words is a list of the words that label the columns of the word-frequency array.

After you are done, take a moment to recognise the topic that the articles about Anne Hathaway and Denzel Washington have in common!





 Q : 


Import pandas as pd.
Create a DataFrame components_df from model.components_, setting columns=words so that columns are labeled by the words.
Print components_df.shape to check the dimensions of the DataFrame.
Use the .iloc[] accessor on the DataFrame components_df to select row 3. Assign the result to component.
Call the .nlargest() method of component, and print the result. This gives the five words with the highest values for that component.


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame: components_df
components_df = pd.DataFrame(model.components_ , columns = words)

# Print the shape of the DataFrame

component = components_df.iloc[3]

Explore the LED digits dataset
In the following exercises, you'll use NMF to decompose grayscale images into their commonly occurring patterns. Firstly, explore the image dataset and see how it is encoded as an array. You are given 100 images as a 2D array samples, where each row represents a single 13x8 image. The images in your dataset are pictures of a LED digital display.



 Q : 



Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Select row 0 of samples and assign the result to digit. For example, to select column 2 of an array a, you could use a[:,2]. Remember that since samples is a NumPy array, you can't use the .loc[] or iloc[] accessors to select specific rows or columns.
Print digit. This has been done for you. Notice that it is a 1D array of 0s and 1s.
Use the .reshape() method of digit to get a 2D array with shape (13, 8). Assign the result to bitmap.
Print bitmap, and notice that the 1s show the digit 7!
Use the plt.imshow() function to display bitmap as an image.




# Import pyplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Select the 0th row: digit
digit = samples[0 , :]

# Print digit
print(digit)

# Reshape digit to a 13x8 array: bitmap
bitmap = digit.reshape(13 , 8)

# Print bitmap
print(bitmap)

# Use plt.imshow to display bitmap
plt.imshow(bitmap , cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()

NMF learns the parts of images
Now use what you've learned about NMF to decompose the digits dataset. You are again given the digit images as a 2D array samples. This time, you are also provided with a function show_as_image() that displays the image encoded by any 1D array:

def show_as_image(sample):
    bitmap = sample.reshape((13, 8))
    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(bitmap, cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
    plt.colorbar()

Import NMF from sklearn.decomposition.
Create an NMF instance called model with 7 components. (7 is the number of cells in an LED display).
Apply the .fit_transform() method of model to samples. Assign the result to features.
To each component of the model (accessed via model.components_), apply the show_as_image() function to that component inside the loop.
Assign the row 0 of features to digit_features.
Print digit_features.

PCA doesn't learn parts
Unlike NMF, PCA doesn't learn the parts of things. Its components do not correspond to topics (in the case of documents) or to parts of images, when trained on images. Verify this for yourself by inspecting the components of a PCA model fit to the dataset of LED digit images from the previous exercise. The images are available as a 2D array samples. Also available is a modified version of the show_as_image() function which colors a pixel red if the value is negative.

After submitting the answer, notice that the components of PCA do not represent meaningful parts of images of LED digits!

Recommend musical artists part I
In this exercise and the next, you'll use what you've learned about NMF to recommend popular music artists! You are given a sparse array artists whose rows correspond to artists and whose column correspond to users. The entries give the number of times each artist was listened to by each user.

In this exercise, build a pipeline and transform the array into normalized NMF features. The first step in the pipeline, MaxAbsScaler, transforms the data so that all users have the same influence on the model, regardless of how many different artists they've listened to. In the next exercise, you'll use the resulting normalized NMF features for recommendation!

This data is part of a larger dataset available here.

Normalizer and MaxAbsScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
make_pipeline from sklearn.pipeline.
Create an instance of MaxAbsScaler called scaler.
Create an NMF instance with 20 components called nmf.
Create an instance of Normalizer called normalizer.
Create a pipeline called pipeline that chains together scaler, nmf, and normalizer.
Apply the .fit_transform() method of pipeline to artists. Assign the result to norm_features.



# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer , MaxAbsScaler
