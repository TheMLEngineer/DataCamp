What category of problem is this?
You're no novice to data science, but let's make sure we agree on the basics.

As Peter from DrivenData explained in the video, you're going to be working with school district budget data. This data can be classified in many ways according to certain labels, e.g. Function: Career & Academic Counseling, or Position_Type: Librarian.

Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the probability for each possible label by relying on some correctly labeled examples.


 Q : 
 

 What type of machine learning problem is this?


 A : 


 Supervised Learning, because the model will be trained using labeled examples.

What is the goal of the algorithm?
As you know from previous courses, there are different types of supervised machine learning problems. In this exercise you will tell us what type of supervised machine learning problem this is, and why you think so.

Remember, your goal is to correctly label budget line items by training a supervised model to predict the probability of each possible label, taking most probable label as the correct label.


 A : 


 Classification, because predicted probabilities will be used to select a label class.
